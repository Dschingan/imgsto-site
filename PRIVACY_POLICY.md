## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Media Files
- **Images and Videos**: We access your device's media files only when you explicitly select them for viewing, organizing, sharing, or backing up within the app.
- **Purpose**: To provide core gallery functionality, image organization, quick access features, and optional backup to your Google Photos account.
- **Storage**: Media files remain on your device by default. If you choose to back up or upload media, the files are transmitted directly to your Google Photos account under your control. We do not operate our own servers for storing your media.

### 1.2 App Usage Data
- **Overlay Usage**: We track when overlay features are activated to optimize performance.
- **Favorites**: Your favorite images list is stored locally on your device.
- **Settings**: App preferences and configuration data stored locally.

### 1.3 Device Information

- **Network Status**: To determine connectivity for background sync features.

## 3. Information Sharing

### 3.1 Third-Party Services

- **Google Photos APIs**: Used to upload media directly to your own Google Photos account when you initiate such actions. We do not access or store your Google account credentials; authentication is handled by Google.

**Note for Play Store Submission:**
This privacy policy specifically addresses the use of SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission for overlay functionality and battery optimization exemption for background processing (requested only with user consent when necessary). The app is paid and does not display ads, and does not use the Advertising ID. All restricted permissions are justified by core app functionality and user benefit. The optional Google Photos backup occurs only when initiated by the user and uploads directly to the user's Google account. Firebase Analytics is used for anonymized usage metrics, and consent is obtained where required (e.g., EEA/UK) via UMP.

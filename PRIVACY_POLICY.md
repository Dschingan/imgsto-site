**Note for Play Store Submission:**
This privacy policy specifically addresses the use of SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission for overlay functionality, battery optimization exemption for background processing (requested only with user consent when necessary), and advertising ID usage for personalized ads. Overlay surfaces never show ads. All restricted permissions are justified by core app functionality and user benefit. The optional Google Photos backup occurs only when initiated by the user and uploads directly to the user's Google account.
